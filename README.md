# Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP) 

#### Applied Quantitative Logistics(AQL) Project 

In this project, we investigate a Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP). Our proposed solution is a variant of the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), here we are considering a situation where we have only one depot. Eventually, this can be extended to a multi-depot scenario. We consider a situation in which distributors who are used to conventionally powered vehicles are faced with the daunting task of managing a fleet of both traditional fuelled vehicles and alternatively fuelled vehicles. Alternative Fuel-powered vehicles (AFVs) start from the existing warehouses, serve customers and, at the end of the day, return to the original warehouses. The limited travel distance before refuelling of AFVs forces them to function within a limited range especially if the distributor does not have the means of providing multiple refuelling stations.
