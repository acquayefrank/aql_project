# Green Vehicle Routing Problem (MDGVRP) 
#### Applied Quantitative Logistics(AQL) Project 
In this project, we investigate a Multi-Depot Green Vehicle Routing Problem (MDGVRP) with capacitated vehicles. Our proposed solution is a variant of the Multi-Depot Green Vehicle Routing Problem (MDGVRP), but here we are considering a situation where we have only one depot. Eventually, this can be extended to a multi-depot scenario. We consider a situation in which distributors using conventional powered vehicles are faced with the daunting task of managing a fleet of both traditional fuelled vehicles and capacitated Alternative Fuel Stations (AFSs). Alternative Fuel-powered vehicles (AFVs) start from the existing warehouses, serve customers and, at the end of the day, return to the original warehouses. The limited fuel tank capacity of AFVs forces them to visit the Alternative Fuel Stations (AFS) for refuelling purposes. The goal is to reduce the total production of oil. We propose a solution which uses branch and bound to maximize distribution path when needed and minimize distribution path when needed.
