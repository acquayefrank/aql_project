### A solution for a (Mixed) Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem(CGVRP).
More and more distributors are faced with the daunting task of moving towards green energy in all aspects of operations. This often involves switching distribution vehicles to vehicles that consume alternate fuel. The challenge with alternate fuel however is the limited travel distance before the need for refuelling. Hence these distributors often have vehicles that use traditional fuel and vehicles that use alternate fuel. Our goal is therefore to produce an optimisation algorithm that maximizes the distribution paths of green fuelled vehicles and minimizing the distribution paths of traditional vehicles all this while ensuring that the total demand for services/products is met.
