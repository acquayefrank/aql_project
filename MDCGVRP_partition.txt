We solve a variant of the Muti Depot Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (MDCGVRP).

Given 7 nodes.  {A, B, C, D, E, F, G} with each node representing a location.

And Nodes {A, G} representing our depots, with nodes {B, C, D, E, F} representing customers 


    A       B       C       D       E       F       G
A   100     9       6       8       6       7       5     
B   9       100     5       9       7       6       4
C   6       5       100     7       6       9       11
D   8       9       7       100     12      11      10
E   6       7       6       12      100     9       6
F   7       6       9       11      9       100     2
G   5       4       11       10     6       2       100

Partitioning Customers into Depots:
-----------------------------------
We first find the closest depot for each customer. 
Then we assign the customer to the closest depot.
In case the distance between the customer and all depots are the same for all depots pick the depot with least customers,
In case all depots have the same number of customers randomly assign a customer to a depot

customers_of_depot_G = {}
customers_of_depot_A = {}

c(B, A) = 9 and c(B, G) = 4 ,  Therefore assign customer B to G 

customers_of_depot_G = {B}

c(C, A) = 6 and c(C, G) = 11,  Therefore assign customer C to A

customers_of_depot_A = {C}

c(D, A) = 8 and c(D, G) = 10, Therefore assign customer D to A 

customers_of_depot_A = {C, D}

c(E, A) = 6 and c(E, G) = 6, Therefore check depot with least customers

length(customers_of_depot_G) = 1
length(customers_of_depot_A) = 2
Therefore assign customer E to G

customers_of_depot_G = {B, E}

c(F, A) = 7 and c(F, G) = 2 ,  Therefore assign customer F to G 

customers_of_depot_G = {B, E, F}
customers_of_depot_A = {C, D}

Assigning Green Vehicles and Conventional Vehicles to Customers:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Assume Green Vehicles have a total distance of 20. Then threshold is 40/2 = 20

For each node compute the shortest arc starting from the depot.
If total arcs travelled less than 20 (threshold) continue with previous step else stop.

For Depot A:

    c(A, C) = 6  
    c(C, D) = 7
+           = 13

Since 13 is less than 20. Green Vehicle can serve customers C and D at depot A.


For Depot G: 
    c(G, F) = 2
    c(F, B) = 6
    c(B, E) = 7
+           = 15

Since 15 is less than 20. Green Vehicle can serve customers B, E and F at depot G.

In this case Conventional vehicles are not used. Perhaps with more data they will be.
